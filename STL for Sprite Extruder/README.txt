# STL for Sprite Extruder

We provide you with a firmware based on the Accelerometer of the Idea Sprite extruder (' Accelerometer mount.STL'), which needs to be installed at the end of the extruder:
① Insert the PortableInputShaper into the print and lock it with 2 M3*10 screws with half round head;
② Remove the top two M3 cross screws of the motor;
③ Fix the print on the motor with a semicircle head M3*25.
You can follow the instructions (https://github.com/FYSETC/FYSETC-PortableInputShaper\STL for Sprite Extruder) download firmware, we provide you with the print file.

If you want to build the latest firmware, you will need your own configuration file.
